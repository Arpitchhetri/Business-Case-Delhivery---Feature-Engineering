# 🚚 Delhivery Logistics Optimization – Trip Performance & Route Efficiency

## 📦 Project Description

This project aims to analyze operational performance data from **Delhivery**, one of India’s leading logistics providers. The dataset includes thousands of delivery trips made across a network of distribution centers and routes. The primary goal is to identify inefficiencies in the delivery network, detect patterns of delay or deviation, and provide actionable recommendations to improve the **overall efficiency, reliability, and cost-effectiveness** of logistics operations.

We focus on comparing **estimated vs actual trip metrics**, analyzing **center-level and route-level trends**, and pinpointing problem areas using **data-driven techniques**.

---

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Analyze discrepancies between **OSRM-estimated time/distance** and **actual delivery performance**
- Detect patterns of **delay**, **distance/time deviation**, and **inefficient routes**
- Evaluate performance across different **routes**, **trip segments**, and **distribution centers**
- Provide insights to help **optimize route planning**, **resource allocation**, and **delivery predictability**

---

## 📊 Insights & Observations

### 1. 🚦 Significant Delay in Actual Trips
- **Avg. delay** across all trips is consistently higher than the OSRM-estimated time.
- **Top 10 routes** contribute to over 60% of the total delay — a clear focus area for optimization.

### 2. 🛣️ High Deviation in Certain Routes
- Several routes show a **>30% deviation** in both time and distance.
- This may indicate **traffic congestion**, **route detours**, or **data inconsistencies**.

### 3. 🏢 Center-Level Bottlenecks
- Certain **source or destination centers** repeatedly appear in delayed trips.
- These may have capacity issues, scheduling problems, or operational delays.

### 4. 🧭 Segment-Level Delays
- Segment analysis reveals that **middle segments** (in multi-stop trips) experience more delays than the start or end segments — possibly due to poor handoff or idle times.

### 5. 📉 Underutilized Routes
- Some routes have **very few trips** but high average delays, suggesting they may not be optimized or necessary.

## ✅ Business Recommendations

- **Prioritize improvement on high-delay routes** by re-evaluating traffic patterns and rescheduling delivery times.
- **Implement real-time monitoring** for source/destination hubs with repeated delays.
- **Optimize route assignment** by benchmarking high-efficiency routes and applying similar strategies elsewhere.
- **Analyze segment-level delay causes** and create tighter SLAs or checklists for multi-leg journeys.
- Use this data to **train predictive models** for trip duration forecasting and proactive delay alerts.

## 📈 Outcome

This analysis empowers Delhivery to improve **delivery reliability**, **reduce fuel and time costs**, and **enhance customer satisfaction**. These insights can be extended into real-time dashboards or integrated into routing algorithms to proactively manage logistics efficiency.
